            <p class="description">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p class="description">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and
                a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list_item">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
                    browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.</li>
                <li class="list_item">Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                    running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

            <p class="description">This guide assumes you have the following basic background :</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list_item">A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li class="list_item">Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
            <header class="heading">JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p class="description">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some
                others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p class="description">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,
                JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is
                inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special
                declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <p class="description">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare
                all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public,
                private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function
                return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

            <header class="heading">Hello world</header>
            <p class="description">To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first
                "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <p class="description">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and
                a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <code class="code">function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header class="heading">Variables</header>
            <p class="description">You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of
                variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p class="description">A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
                subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include
                the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p class="description">You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can
                also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 6-->

            <header class="heading">Declaring variables</header>
            <p class="description">You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <code class="code">var x = 42.
              </code>
            <p class="description">This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p class="description">By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code class="code">x = 42.</code>
            <p class="description">This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You
                shouldn't use this variant.</p>
            <p class="description">With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code class="code">let y = 13.</code>
            <p class="description">This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                below.</p>

        </section>


        <!-- SECTION 7-->
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header class="heading">Variable scope</header>
            <p class="description">When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable,
                because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a
                function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
            <p class="description">JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a
                variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
                within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
            <code class="code">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
            <p class="description">This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
            </p>
            <code class="code">if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                defined</code>

        <!-- SECTION 8-->
        <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header class="heading">Global variables</header>
            <p class="description">Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global
                object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
            <p class="description">Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from
                another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
                phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                parent.phoneNumber.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 9-->
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header class="heading">Constants</header>
            <p class="description">You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a
                constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or
                dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
            <code class="code">const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <p class="description">A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script
                is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
            <p class="description">The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If
                the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
            <p class="description">You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the
                same scope. For example:</p>
            <code class="code">// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                }</code>
            <p class="description">However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed
                without problems.</p>
            <code class="code">const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
                }</code>

        <!-- SECTION 10-->
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header class="heading">Data types</header>
            <p class="description">The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list_item">Six data types that are primitives:
                <li class="list_item inner_item">Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li class="list_item inner_item">null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is
                    case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                <li class="list_item inner_item">undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                <li class="list_item inner_item">Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li class="list_item inner_item">String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li class="list_item inner_item">Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique
                    and immutable.</li>
                </li>
                <li class="list_item">and Object</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="description">Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform
                useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the
                language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your
                application can perform.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
            <header class="heading">if...else statement</header>
            <p class="description">Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the
                optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code class="code">if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            <p class="description">condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an
                explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is
                executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                including further nested if statements.</p>

            <p class="description">You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested
                in sequence, as follows:</p>
            <code class="code">if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
            } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</code>
            <p class="description">In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates
                to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... })
                . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
            </p>
            <code class="code">if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
            <p class="description">It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because
                the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the
                following code:</p>
            <code class="code">if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            <p class="description">If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to
                put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
            <code class="code">if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

            <header class="heading">while statement</header>
            <p class="description">A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates
                to true. A while statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code class="code">while (condition) statement</code>
            <p class="description">If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control
                passes to the statement following the loop.
            </p>

            <p class="description">The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition
                returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false,
                execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
            <p class="description">To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those
                statements.</p>
            <p class="description">Example:</p>
            <p class="description">The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
            <code class="code">var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
            <p class="description">With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and
                n take on the following values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="list_item">After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li class="list_item">After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li class="list_item">After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="description">After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop
                    terminates.</p>
